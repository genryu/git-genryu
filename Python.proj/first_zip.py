# Assume text is a variable that
# holds a string. Write Python code
# that prints out the position
# of the second occurrence of 'zip'
# in text, or -1 if it does not occur
# at least twice.

# For example,
#text = 'all zip files are zipped' 
# >>> 18
text = 'all zip files are compressed'
# >>> -1

#text = "all zip files are zipped" 

#ENTER CODE BELOW HERE

zip=text.find('zip')
print text.find('zip',zip+1)
